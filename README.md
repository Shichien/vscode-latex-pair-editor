# vscode-latex-pair-editor

LaTeX-Pair-Editor will enhance your editing when writing LaTeX pair environments, such as `\begin` and `\end`.

## Features

### âœ¨ Synchronized Environment Name Editing

Simply place your cursor inside an environment name, and a second cursor will automatically appear in the corresponding tag, allowing you to edit both simultaneously.

In fact, we just created a new cursor, so multi-cursor is supported.
